                <br>
                <p id="pDesign">We understand the pressure on parents about the academic performance of their wards. Every child does not possess the competent capabilities. There could be the logical issues related to the child as this modern world tend to create in a smooth life of the student. Further, every parent can not be well acquainted with ways to help out their wards in academics. We, at TSA offer remedial classes to the students who face difficulties with academic performance. With the parents consent, we arrange remedial classes after school hours. The purpose of the class is to prepare the students for catching up with the expected level of the class. We believe in creating atmosphere for the students which is conveniently amicable to create enthusiastic spirit for learning amongst the students. Every child is important for us.</p>
