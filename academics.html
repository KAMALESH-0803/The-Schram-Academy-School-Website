                <h2 id="pm">PRINCIPAL MESSAGE</h2>
                <p id="pDesign">Couple of centuries ago schools were created to produce workforce to suit the industries and the concept of school was based on the Prussian‐type schools for mass education. We have moved on to the digital‐age and beyond, and we want our school system to simulate the outside world. Also, the current scenario demands schools to mirror the world. This is exactly what we intend to achieve at The Schram Academy: create individuals with their potential and skills fully developed; prepare children to find their place in the global space; shape them to contribute to the larger community; make them to integrate conservative values with modern life; bring joy to themselves and others; adapt to accomplish and finally transcend the bounds of student life.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p id="pDesign">Teachers at The Schram Academy work with unapologetic activism to develop the iGeneration to completely fit into this world: to be thinkers, collaborators, achievers and responsible global citizens. Team TSA has definitely converted challenges into opportunities and will continue to care for every child and be responsible for every child’s progress in the most engaging manner.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p id="pDesign">Strategically, we believe in dynamism. TSA is a dynamic institution. Every new change defies but succumbs to failure because we have the structure that allows our students to scale every possible height, to stand tall as beacons of inspiration- a testimony that education imparted in the right way can bring hope to an otherwise grim world.</p>

                <p id="pDesign">The Schram Academy (TSA) in Chennai has an academic year that runs from April thru March (see Calendar). The preprimary section has developed its own curriculum based on a balanced approach of the best of Montessori and kindergarten methods that include projects, cocurricular activities such as watersport, dance, music, field trips and computer-aided education.The curriculum adopted is that prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi and includes the core subjects of language (with Hindi, Tamil and French offered as second and third languages), Mathematics, Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Biotechnology), Social Sciences, Information Technology, General Knowledge, Value Education and Physical Education. The Senior Secondary Section has various groups with English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, Accountancy, Business Studies, Economics and Mass Media, to cater to the students’ needs.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p id="pDesign">Students and faculty are kept updated about international trends in the teaching-learning process via TSA’s Visiting International Faculty program. The Visiting Foreign Faculty Drs. Willem Bustraan, Senior Lecturer and Researcher, University for Professional Education, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, has played an integral role in the professional growth of the faculty of TSA. His consistent efforts during his visits for the past seven years have enabled this paradigm shift in the academic streams of TSA and have paved the way to inculcate an attitude of professionalism in the teachers and set our sights on TSA becoming ‘A Professional Development School of the 21st Century’.</p>
                <p id="pDesign">Mr. Johan Elgersma, Senior Project Manager, ING, The Netherlands, Trustee of The Schram Foundation, has helped TSA frame the Educational Innovation Management system and has also been instrumental in implementing a structure that strives for Quality Assurance.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p id="pDesign">Club Activities provide opportunities for students to widen their knowledge and keep them updated with the latest information from the Internet, various library resources and personal observations — and to participate in intra- and interschool competitions in mathematics, science, social sciences, art and literature.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p id="pDesign">Regular Field Trips are organized to places of curriculum-related educational importance so that all students (Nursery, Primary and Middle School classes) are given the opportunity to explore, experience and expand the knowledge they derive in the classroom.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p id="pDesign">A detailed description of TSA’s academic and cocurricular activities in the 2013/2014 academic year may be found in the Annual Report of the school.</p>
